    # Section Description
    st.write("""
        In this section, we discuss how we handled missing values in the dataset. Rather than directly applying mean, median, or mode imputation, 
        we took a strategic approach by observing the relationships between the features and considering class imbalances. 
        This allowed us to make more informed decisions about how to fill the missing values, ensuring that the imputation 
        aligned with the underlying patterns in the data.

    st.markdown("### Missing Values Imputation Approach")

    st.write("""
        We identified the features with missing values and applied different imputation techniques based on the type of data and the 
        relationships between features. Instead of just using statistical measures like mean or median, we considered:
        - **Class Imbalances**: Ensuring that the imputation didn't introduce or worsen class imbalances.
        - **Feature Relationships**: Imputing values in a way that respected the correlations between features.
    """)

    # Handling Missing Values in Gender
    st.markdown("### **Gender**")
    st.write("""
        The **Gender** column had missing values. As the dataset was relatively small and there was class imbalance, 
        we noticed the following proportions of gender in the data:
        - **Male**: 81.3%
        - **Female**: 18.7%

        To handle the missing values, we decided to maintain this class ratio by strategically imputing the missing values. 
        We randomly imputed 81% of the missing values as **Male** and the remaining 19% as **Female**, 
        preserving the original distribution in the data. No other significant relationships were found to impute the missing values based on other features.

        The **Married** column had missing values, and the class distribution was as follows:
        - **Married (True)**: 3 records
        - **Not Married (False)**: 611 records

        **Step**: Imputing Missing Values in the Married Column  
        In this step, we address the missing values in the **Married** column, which is a categorical variable indicating whether the applicant is married ("Yes" or "No").

        **Imputation Method**: We used **Mode Imputation**, where missing values are replaced by the most frequent category (mode). This approach is particularly suitable when the number of missing values is small, as is the case with the **Married** column in our dataset. Since the number of missing values is minimal, imputing with the mode ensures that the missing data does not have a significant impact on the analysis.

        **Chosen Approach**: The most frequent value in the **Married** column is **Not Married (False)**. Therefore, we chose to impute all missing values with the **Not Married** label to maintain consistency with the existing distribution.
